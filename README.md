Game description:

A 3D Stealth-Action game where the player must move from a starting point to a finishing point on the game levels while remaining undetected by several surveillance cameras, which are moving from left to right or down to up. The cameras have a limited view, so the player has to find moments when none of the cameras are watching him/her. The player has no ( regular first or third person) view of his/her own, but is shown live surveillance video feed from the cameras, one by one in a fixed pattern, or multiple at the same time, or any mixture of the two. From these views the player has to decide what is the best time to move and how, i.e., when the player is moving around, he canâ€™t actually see himself (as a character) in game.
